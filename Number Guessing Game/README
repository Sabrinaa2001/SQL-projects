This program is a number guessing game where users attempt to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 1000. The user is prompted to enter a username, which is then checked against a PostgreSQL database. If the user has played before, they are greeted with a message showing how many games they've played and their best score (the fewest number of guesses to win). If the user is new, they are welcomed and added to the database. The game continues to prompt the user to guess the number, providing hints if the secret number is higher or lower than their guess. Once the correct number is guessed, the program logs the number of attempts and updates the best score if it's improved.
